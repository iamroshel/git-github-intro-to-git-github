# Welcome to Git/GitHub

## Learning Goals

- Understand the purpose of this module

## Introduction

Many companies in the tech industry use Git on a daily basis, especially for software engineers
Git and GitHub skills are important to have for your job search
Git and GitHub are very powerful, but can also be very complicated
The best way to learn them is by using them
In this section, you will learn to use Git and GitHub for version control and for collaboration. The material covered here should prepare you for the most common usages and workflows that will represent the majority of what you will need for most jobs

## About this Material

Designed to be used across disciplines
Depending on whether you are in the Software Engineering or Data Science program, your setup will be different. It will also differ for Mac vs. Windows users. This means that things in these lessons and labs may not look quite the same as what you're used to
The content - the commands and workflows - will be the same

## Setup

For Software Engineering students, you should have gotten everything you need set up in prework. If you haven't, we strongly recommend you complete all the lessons in the appropriate (Windows or Mac) Environment Setup module, available in the Canvas Prework course or Homeroom, before you continue.

For Data Science students, .....

The specific requirements are outlined below.

### Git

Git should be installed on your local machine. At the time of this writing, the current version of Git is v2.35. While other recent versions of Git should work fine, be aware that the appearance of some Git output may look different for you than it appears in these lessons. 

If you prefer, you can also check and update your Git version using the steps [in this article][updating-git-version].

### GitHub Account

You will need to [sign up for a GitHub account][github-signup], if you do not already have one.

### Install a Code Editor

It will be much easier to follow along with the examples and exercises in this module if you have a text editor installed on your local machine. We use [Visual Studio Code][vscode] (VS Code), but you are free to use whichever text editor you prefer.

## Conclusion

Now that you have these tools in place, you're ready to learn about version control, Git, and GitHub.
